The 32Bit Jam series was created in order to get more people excited about making games inspired by late 90s aesthetics. This jam is for any project that looks like it belongs in the PS1 era. It's the perfect opportunity for developers and artists interested in 3D to have their first stab at it, as simple 3D visuals are part of the aesthetic. Full 3D, 3D mixed with 2D, Full 2D submissions are ALL allowed, as long as they feel like they belong in the same graphical era. Since 2019, this jam has attracted a large community of streamers and developers.
